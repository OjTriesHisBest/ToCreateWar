# ToCreateWar
This is the card game "War". Not an actual war. It's also text-based. 

This is just a bad version of Blackjack but provided a lot of valuable code for the project. You can't "play" the game, only run the simulation.

So nothing really needs to be added to it. It was fun to make. Ok, I'll stop talking now.
